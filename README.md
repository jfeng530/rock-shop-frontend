# Overview
  ### Description
  Rock Shop is an e-commerce web application for purchasing rocks. It utilizes React with inline CSS for a dynamic and interactive user experience. Rock Shop manages user authentication, cart functionality and purchases using JWT, localStorage and a Ruby on Rails backend.
  
  ### Features
  - View, sort and filter rocks by category, price, rating and rarity 
  - Create an account with a unique username and password along with log-in/log-out functionality
  - Add and remove items to a cart where they will be saved and stored in backend
  - Upon logging in, the user's most recent cart (along with its items) will be loaded and rendered
  - View previous purchases (with items, price and total)
  - Edit, update, and delete user account information 
  
  ### Challenges
  - Figuring out how the classes in the back-end will interact with one another to form a fully functioning e-commerce application 
    - Individual cart items became a "joiner-class" (`Purchase`), joining the `Rock` class and the `Order` class
    - Every time an item is added to a cart, a `Purchase` instance is created with the specific `Rock` and the current `Order` (cart)
  - Rendering the current cart associated to user when user logs in
    - Using [JWT](https://www.jwt.io/) and [ActiveModelSerializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers), token, user information, and cart information is sent to the front-end to render the correct user along with their current cart
